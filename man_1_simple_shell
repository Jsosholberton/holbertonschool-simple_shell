.SH NAME
simple_shell - a simple UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
simple_shell [hsh]

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a simple UNIX command line interpreter. It can be executed in two modes: interactive and non-interactive.

In interactive mode, simple_shell displays a prompt, waits for the user to enter a command, and executes it. This mode is indicated by running the program without any arguments:

$ ./simple_shell
#cisfun$ 

In non-interactive mode, simple_shell reads commands from a file or from standard input and executes them. This mode is indicated by running the program with a file argument:

$ echo "ls" | ./hsh
README.md  file_PATH.c  hsh  no_interactive.c  shell.c  shell.h


$ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   842 Apr 27 14:16 file_PATH.c
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 17944 Apr 27 19:52 hsh
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   863 Apr 27 19:38 no_interactive.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3280 Apr 27 19:34 shell.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   468 Apr 27 19:35 shell.h

$ echo "pwd" | ./hsh
/home/user
$

The simple_shell program supports several built-in commands, such as env and exit, which are executed internally by the program. In addition, simple_shell can execute external programs by specifying their path. For example:

$ /bin/ls

Simple_shell also supports command line arguments.

.SH OPTIONS

To execute a command in simple_shell, simply enter the command at the prompt:

$ ./hsh
#cisfun ls
README.md  file_PATH.c  hsh  no_interactive.c  shell.c  shell.h
